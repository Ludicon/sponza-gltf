# Sponza Model

This is an updated version of the Sponza scene provided by the Khronos Group as part of the [glTF-Sample-Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/main/2.0/Sponza/README.md) using the uncompressed textures from [Hans-Kristian Arntzen](https://themaister.net/sponza-gltf-pbr/).

This version of the Sponza Atrium scene was created by Frank Meinl. The original Sponza model was created by Marko Dabrovic in early 2002. Over the years, the Sponza Atrium scene has become one of the most popular 3D scenes for testing global illumination and radiosity due to it's specific architectural structure which is particularly complex for global illumination light.

This glTF model was built with [glTF Transform](https://gltf-transform.dev/) and [gltf-tex](https://github.com/ludicon/gltf-tex), for more details, see this article:
